# Kaggle MNIST Competition in Pytorch
This repo contains the model I created for the MNIST-Kaggle competition, achieving 99.6 % accuracy in my best submission on the site.

The model and repo were made as an exercise after I participated in an [introductory course in Deep Learning](https://niessner.github.io/I2DL/) to see if I could use all the techniques covered in the course myself when creating a model from scratch.
The model created uses the most basic building blocks in Deep Learning for Computer Vision like:
* CNN:s
* Batch Norm-layers
* Dropout-layers
* Data Augmentation

The network itself is rather big for the task and far from fully optimized, but achieves good performance on such an easy task as the MNIST dataset.
